    "## Analysing the Analysers\n",
    "* The role of ‘data scientist’ is poorly defined, both by recruiters and those already acting in such a role. This can be attributed by the sudden emergence of the profession brought on by the proliferation of data available to organisations and the the realisation of technologies capable of analysing such large data sets. The lack of consensus surrounding what is expected of a data scientist results in undue waste of time and expense for both companies and candidates during the recruitment process. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Harris, Patrick & Vaisman set out to offer clarity on this issue. Using a five-page survey offered to data practitioners, the authors enquired about respondents skills, experiences, self-identification and web presence. From the questions asked, the authors engaged in cluster analysis to identify 4 sub-groups of data practioners, each correlated with a set of skills (of which had also undergone cluster analysis). \n",
    "\n",
    "* The 4 sub-groups as identified by Harris, Patrick & Vaisman were:\n",
    " * Data Business people - most focused on the organisation and how data yields profits. Many were entrepreneurs and had lead teams of employees in the past. \n",
    " * Data Creatives - the ‘jack-of-all-trades’. These individuals had the broadest skill set as they had the most variable in the way they ranked their data skills. \n",
    " * Data Developers - Focused on the technical problem of managing data and were the wrote the most code of the 4 ID groups. The majority of data developers had enginneriring or computer science backgrounds. \n",
    " * Data Researcher - Came from an academic background with the majority having published in peer-reviewed journals. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The findings here offer partial support for the ’T-shaped data scientist’ (as defined by Mason & Wiggins, 2010). The idea is that the most successful data scientists are those with a breadth of skills available to offer analysis and insights from data as well as a deeper expertise in at least one aspect of data science. The strongest support for the ’T-shaped model’ can be seen for Data Businesspeople and, to a lesser extent, Data Researchers. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Overall, the findings from this report is a strong model for candidates to communicate their expertise and for organisations both when seeking to recruit to fulfil new positions and when training existing data professionals\n"

    "# **DATA SCIENCE HANDBOOK SUMMARY**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Teaching Data Science and Storytelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Storytelling, according  Joe Blitzstein - Professor of Practice of Statistics at Harvard - is an essential skill for aspiring data scientists:\n",
    "\n",
    ">  *I think there is a real art to getting interpretable results and then communicating those results, \n",
    ">  especially in the age of big data where you have thousands of variables.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Blitzstein views effective story-telling skills as the bridge that links complex data analysis to meaningful results that mobilise change within organisations. He offers the example of data conferences where presenters rush through their slides, but fail to communicate the consequence of their findings. Indeed, in such a collaborative industry, data scientists are required to work in teams of people with diverse backgrounds. Those who succeed in this profession need the ability to put themselves in the shoes of their audience, to convey complex ideas and findings into terms that align with their skills and interests. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to communicate complex ideas simply benefits the individual data scientist as well:\n",
    "> *When you can’t explain something clearly, it’s a sign that you haven’t thought it through fully \n",
    "> yourself*\n",
    "\n",
    "A data scientist who can not convey information effectively may need to reassess their understanding of their own research. \n",
    "\n",
    "When asked to offer advice for those interested in studying data science, Blitzstein says that one should constantly think about the ‘why’ behind the research. Why is this data set interesting? Why is it relevant?\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, effective story-telling is an immuatable skill for all current and aspiring data scientists. When this ability is lacking, individuals may find that the impact of their projects are left unappreciated and innocuous. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Data is the Voice of Your Customer\n",
    "\n",
    "Riley Newman, Head of Data at Airbnb uses this chapter to comment on talk around the term “big data”:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *What do big data and teenage sex have in common? - Everybody is talking about it. Nobody \n",
    "> knows what it is.*\n",
    "\n",
    "“Big data has become a buzz word and it is meaningless unless it leads to actionable change within an organisation. Newman notes that in order to achieve this, data scientists must strike a balance between technical and communication skills. At AirBnB this all begins with candidate selction. As head of data, Newman and his team identify appropriate candidates by asking them to solve data-driven problems with real-world implications. They are often problems that the company has had to face in the past. \n",
    "\n",
    "The candidate selection used by AirBnB helps choose data scientists that will add value to the company. \n",
    "\n",
    ">*I think data can add value everywhere. It’s the voice of your customer*\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with this thinking, AirBnb use data to effect change in all areas of their business. From analysing how customers hear about their services, to the development of online and offline marketing to facilitate growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "When probed about the future of data within organisations, Newman believes that the field will soon be open to those that are less technical. However, more powerful, simplier-to-use tools will never be sufficient in transforming data into added value to the company.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Good data science is more about the questions you pose of the data rather than data munging \n",
    "> *and analysis"

    "* Overview:\n",
    "  * Comments made in 2016 by Construction Mogul Tim Gurner ignored spirallinng prices and negative gearing in Australia's housing affordability crisis. The culprits? Too much smashed avocado and take-away coffees.\n",
    "  * This data set will set the record straight and attempt to understand the true relationship between buying a home and brunch's most popular menu item. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data:\n",
    " * Housing affordability data (most likely attainable via data.gov.au. These will hopefully include metrics such as median house prices during different time periods, % of people looking to buy a home but unable to afford (those locked out of the housing market).\n",
    " * Data on amount spent on breakfast foods - especially smashed avocado but also other popular menu items (this may be tricker to locate and may require data collection)\n",
    " * Social demographics data of participants including age, income, education, suburb they are looking to buy etc\n",
    "\n",
    "* Outcome:\n",
    " * The aim is to understand the relationship between the farcical claim that smashed avocados are responsible for housing affordability crisis. Findings could put to end the Millenial blame game - \"you need to save more\" - and point the finger at the true barriers to buying a first home.\n",
    " \n",
    "* Modelling ideas:\n",
    "  * So far, I plan to run a logistic regression that predicts \"owns a home vs doesn't own a home\" to find out which variables are good predictors of locking individuals out of the housing market\n",
    "  * Other ideas should form as I progress through the course."

    "##  Idea 2: Uber Vs Taxi?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overview:\n",
    "  * We order a ride (either Uber or Taxi) when we need to get somewhere fast. When you're on the move, you usually don't have time to assess the quality of your choices.\n",
    "  * Ubers are generally cheaper but may take longer to arrive, especially on busy roads where taxis are readily available. Factor in surge pricing and sometimes cabs are the better choice.\n",
    "  * This analysis will attempt to create a model that predicts and compares the price of both a taxi and an uber for a given destination at a given time, from a stated pick-up location. This will help users make an informed decision on which service to use. This could even be in the form of an easy-to-use app. \n",
    " \n",
    "* Data:\n",
    " * Data on cab and Uber fares at diferent times of the day in order to offer predictions.\n",
    " * real-time traffic conditions and estimated times for Uber to arrive at pick-up point (may be very difficult to find and incorporate into model)\n",
    " * Cab fees for card transactions - the model could ask user if they have cash. If no, add % to travel cost.\n",
    " * number of people on the ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Outcome:\n",
    " * The aim is to provide an easy-to-use predictive model (most likely in the form of a simple app) that compares the cost effectiveness of riding in an Uber vs Cab. Perfect when making decisions during a late night.\n",
    " \n",
    "* Modelling ideas:\n",
    "  * So far, I do not have any modelling ideas. I am not sure that the topics covered so far - linear and logistic - modelling would be appropriate. Will need to research further."

    "##  Idea 3: Why aren't people buying iPhones?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overview:\n",
    "  * iPhone sales are the bread and butter of Apple's business model. They entice interested but wary customers, new to the smartphone market, and invite them to take a bite out of the proverbial apple. From an iPhone usually follows additional purchases of Apple hardware such as iPads and Macs, not to mention additional revenue from subscriptions for Apple Music, iCloud and other services.\n",
    "  * However, data suggests that iphone sales are slowing. People are upgrading less frequently. Can we predict why?\n",

    " * Customer data that may help predict what factors encourage upgrades - current iphone being used, other Apple products owned, general demographics data.\n",
    " * Recently Tim Cook attributed the 'pause' in 2017 iphone sales on rumours. Therefore, data on number of rumours surrounding a new launch. Could find data from each launch period and see how the number of rumours affects upgrade choices.\n",
    " * price of iphone vs competitor smart phones\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* Outcome:\n",
    " * To understand the factors underlying the purchase/upgrade decisions of a new iPhone. This could offer real-world and actionable insights to Apple and other smart phone providers.\n",
    " * To understand the smartphone market more generally as this could indicate to other companies where to focus their spending. ie maybe smartphone sales have reached their peak and companies should invest in R&D to innovate towards the next stage in technolocial advancement.\n",

    "##  Idea 4: The impact of Marriage Equality on Queer Youth\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overview:\n",
    "  * When it comes to the fight for marriage equality, the most potent argument is that legalisation will aid in reducing mental health problems for members of the queer community. \n",
    "  *Previous research has demonstrated that queer individuals are one of the most stigmatised social groups, a group that suffers from high levels of depression, anxiety and attempted suicide. \n",
    "  * The aim of this research would be to compare the mental wellbeing of queer individuals in countries that have passed equal marriage laws Vs those that have not. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data:\n",
    " * Mental health metrics (attempted suicide rates, rates of depression, anxiety, potentially looking at criminal records) in countries both with and without equal marriage. \n",
    " * Health spending on queer youth in each type of country - to assess the financial costs for the healthcare system. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Outcome:\n",
    " * The aim is to provide quantitative evidence that same-sex marriage has a role in elevating the mental well-being of queer individuals. Such evidence would buttress support for marriage equality, especially if results imply decreased reliance on health system services. \n",
    " \n",
    "* Modelling ideas:\n",
    "  * Linear regression to determine which factors influence mental well being for queer individuals and to determine the strength of any relationships that may exist (particularly equal marriage legalisation). "

    "  * With its 9th season currently on the air (not including 2 All-stars seasons), the popularity of Rue Paul's Drag Race has grown year by year. Each week viewers tune in to watch Drag Queens lip-synch for their lives in the hope of becoming America's Next Drag Superstar. \n",
    "  * Nearly 1 million viewers watched the Premiere of Season 9 earlier this year. The show's huge following means that fans are anxious to know who will take the crown. This analysis will attempt to create a predictive model that determines how long - as measured by number of episodes - each contestant remains in the show (their survival rate) with the ultimate goal of predicting each season's winner. The model may even be able to create odds ratios for each contestant. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data:\n",
    " * From previous seasons, one can collect data on variables such as the number of challenge wins, number of lipsyns performed during the season. \n",

    "\n",
